##  How It Works

- You ask a question → frontend sends to Flask via POST
- Flask uses SentenceTransformer to embed your query
- FAISS finds the closest matching answer
- LLaMA rewrites it to sound like a warm, caring friend using natural emojis
- The response is shown in a friendly bubble chat UI 🫶

##  Customization

Want your own logo?
