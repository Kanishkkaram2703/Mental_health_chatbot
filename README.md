# Mental Health Chatbot – Mr.KK 🤍

An empathetic, human-touch AI chatbot for mental health support — built using TinyLLaMA, FAISS, and a beautifully designed HTML interface.

This repository contains 3 versions of the chatbot — all with the same backend, but with different levels of frontend user experience.
